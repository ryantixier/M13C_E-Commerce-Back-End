## Installation

To use this application clone this repository's code and follow these installation procedures (below). This application also requires a back-end testing framework to be used; Insomnia was utilized for that purpose during the creation of this code.

1. Clone the source code from this repository.
2. Download a back-end testing framework (e.g. Insomnia) for testing purposes.
3. Download MySQL Workbench for database creation/access.
4. Run `npm i` from the terminal to install the following dependencies:

```
    npm i dotenv
    npm i express
    npm i mysql2
    npm i sequelize
```

4. Use your downloaded, back-end testing framework to set up get/post/put/delete routes as needed.

## Usage

Categories, Tags, and Products are all accessible through their assigned id's. Any item can be accessed from those options by using the resources's unique id, in order retreive, update, or delete a specific resource. If using a back-end framework, GET-ALL tests may be performed to return the stock on any given set of inventory.
